# Dark Terminal Theme Profile

A nice theme designed to reduce the strain on your eyes and also, as a bonus made to enrich the Terminal user experience.
The colors are nice and pastelly, and the background is semi-transparent with a blur effect to sooth the mind, and calm the soul.

Enjoy :)

1. Install the font by double clicking it, or using your Command (âŒ˜) and O keyboard shortcut, and then pressing "Install" inside the Font Book app which should open soon after
